# Uncommon HTML innerHTML Bug: Replacing and Referencing Elements

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug that can occur when using `innerHTML` in HTML.  The bug arises from replacing an element with `innerHTML` in a way that invalidates subsequent references to that element in JavaScript.

## Bug Description
The `bug.html` file contains code that attempts to modify the content of a div using `innerHTML`. However, the new content also includes a div element with the same ID, causing an error because the element references are no longer valid after the replacement. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct approach, which involves carefully considering how to manage element references when using `innerHTML`. The preferred solution is to use DOM manipulation methods such as `appendChild` or `insertBefore` to avoid such issues.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the error message in the browser's console (usually accessed by pressing F12).
